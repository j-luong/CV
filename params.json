Perhaps my proudest achievement to date was the successful deployment and release to clients of a reporting module I was product owner for.\r\n\r\nI had worked for almost two years in my scrum agile team on the project, and after giving many end-of-sprint demos; having successful and unsuccessful MVPs; many bug fixes, incidents (minor and major!), and an endless amount of meetings, the satisfaction of finally releasing a live product to the wild made me realise, this is the industry I want to work in...just not as a consultant.\r\n\r\nHaving come from the 'other side' of tech, and from having worked with many developers during my career, it always amazed me to see what can be achieved by a good team of developers - I can't count the number of times they saved my ass with a quick bugfix in the minutes before presenting a demo.\r\n\r\nI found myself wanting to learn more of this magic the developers called code, and with that I eventually found my way to [Makers Academy](www.makersacademy.com).\r\n\r\n# Projects\r\n\r\nWeek |Name | Description | Technology | Testing |\r\n---|---|---|---|---|---\r\n10 | [Challenge Accepted](https://github.com/challenge-accepted-team) ([Demo](https://vimeo.com/182997446)) | Challenge Accepted is a mobile app that facilitates social betting, think you can beat your friend at ping-pong?

As such, I am familiar with the Agile Scrum development process and using the industry standard software Jira to manage our work.\r\n\r\nI regularly took part in various Scurm related activities such as: creating user stories, sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint review sessions, and backlog management.\r\n\r\n**Team work**\r\n\r\nHaving worked for two large companies, I understand the value of a good team. My time as Product Owner involved a team of 3 developers and 3 consultants (including myself).\r\n\r\nThe need for constant and effective communication through daily stand-ups, retrospectives, sprint reviews, and various other methods meant we were able to work through any obsticle together.\r\n\r\n**Curious nature**\r\n\r\nMy role as an Application Support Analyst required me to be curious. When things broke, it was my job to find out why; and it was my job to communicate this effectively to both client and the development team, if it needed escalation.\r\n\r\n**Documentation**\r\n\r\nYou don't like doing it, I don't like doing it, nobody likes doing it. Throughout my career, particularly as a Product Owner, documentation was core responsibility. I am familiar with updating and maintaining documentation, and editing and updating internal wikis.\r\n\r\nI don't like it, but I do it because it must be done (and because knowledge is the [path to wisdom and enlightenment](http://johnkapeleris.com/blog/?p=1752)).\r\n\r\n# Education\r\n\r\n**Makers Academy** (07/2016 – 09/2016)\r\n- 12-week intensive coding bootcamp\r\n- Pair Programming\r\n- Independent learner and problem-solver\r\n- OOP, TDD, SOLID, MVC, XP\r\n- Software Craftsmanship\r\n- Ruby, Rails, Javascript\r\n- Rspec, Jasmine, Mocha, Capybara\r\n\r\n**Escape Studios - 3D for Visual Effects** (09/2014 – 12/2014)\r\n\r\n**FDM - Trainee Murex Analyst** (05/2012 – 08/2012)\r\n\r\n**University of Westminister - BSc Computer Games design and programming** *1st class honours* (2007 – 2010)\r\n\r\n_Final year project: [Investigation and Application of Physics in Cue Sports](https://github.com/j-luong/MyBilliards)_\r\n",
