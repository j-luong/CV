# Profile

From Software Consultant to Junior Web Developer in 12-weeks...

As a consultant I had many tasks, from general app support to product ownership in a fully agile team. Perhaps my proudest achievement to date was the successful deployment and release to clients of a reporting module I was product owner for.

I had worked for almost two years in my scrum agile team on the project, and after giving many end-of-sprint demos; having successful and unsuccessful MVPs; many bug fixes, incidents (minor and major!), and an endless amount of meetings, the satisfaction of finally releasing a live product to the wild made me realise, this is the industry I want to work in...just not as a consultant.

Having come from the 'other side' of tech, and from having worked with many developers during my career, it always amazed me to see what can be achieved by a good team of developers - I can't count the number of times they saved my ass with a quick bugfix in the minutes before presenting a demo.

I found myself wanting to learn more of this magic the developers called code, and with that I eventually found my way to [Makers Academy](www.makersacademy.com).

# Skills

**Agile Scrum**

As a Software Consultant I was working in a very Agile Scrum focused environment. As such, I am familiar with the Agile Scrum development process and using the industry standard software Jira to manage our work.

I regularly took part in various Scurm related activities such as: creating user stories, sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint review sessions, and backlog management.

**Team work**

Having worked for two large companies, I understand the value of a good team. My time as Product Owner involved a team of 3 developers and 3 consultants (including myself).

The need for constant and effective communication through daily stand-ups, retrospectives, sprint reviews, and various other methods meant we were able to work through any obsticle together.

**Curious nature**

My role as an Application Support Analyst required me to be curious. When things broke, it was my job to find out why; and it was my job to communicate this effectively to both client and the development team, if it needed escalation.

**Documentation**

You don't like doing it, I don't like doing it, nobody likes doing it. Throughout my career, particularly as a Product Owner, documentation was core responsibility. I am familiar with updating and maintaining documentation, and editing and updating internal wikis.

I don't like it, but I do it because it must be done (and because knowledge is the [path to wisdom and enlightenment](http://johnkapeleris.com/blog/?p=1752)).
