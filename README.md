# Profile

I recently graduated from Maker's Academy, a 12-week coding bootcamp, with the aim of becoming a Jr. Web Developer. Prior to this, my background was in Software Consultancy.

As a consultant I had many tasks, from general app support to product ownership in a fully agile team. Perhaps my proudest achievement to date was the successful deployment and release to clients of a reporting module I was product owner for. 

I had worked for almost two years in my scrum agile team on the project, and after giving many sprint review demos; having successful and unsuccessful MVPs; many bug fixes, incidents (minor and major!), and an endless amount of meetings, the satisfaction of finally releasing a live product to the wild made me realise, this is the industry I want to work in...just not as a consultant.

Having come from the 'other side' of tech, and from having worked with many developers during my career, it always amazed me to see what can be achieved by a good team of developers - I can't count the number of times they saved my ass with a quick bugfix in the minutes before presenting an end of sprint demo. I found myself wanting to learn more of this magic the developers called code, and with that I eventually found my way to Maker's.
