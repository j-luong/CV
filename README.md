# Profile

From Software Consultant to Jr. Web Developer in 12-weeks...

As a consultant I had many tasks, from general app support to product ownership in a fully agile team. Perhaps my proudest achievement to date was the successful deployment and release to clients of a reporting module I was product owner for.

I had worked for almost two years in my scrum agile team on the project, and after giving many end-of-sprint demos; having successful and unsuccessful MVPs; many bug fixes, incidents (minor and major!), and an endless amount of meetings, the satisfaction of finally releasing a live product to the wild made me realise, this is the industry I want to work in...just not as a consultant.

Having come from the 'other side' of tech, and from having worked with many developers during my career, it always amazed me to see what can be achieved by a good team of developers - I can't count the number of times they saved my ass with a quick bugfix in the minutes before presenting a demo.

I found myself wanting to learn more of this magic the developers called code, and with that I eventually found my way to [Makers Academy](www.makersacademy.com).

# Skills

**Agile Scrum**

As a Software Consultant I was working in a very Agile Scrum focused environment. As such, I am familiar with the Agile Scrum development process and using the industry standard software Jira to manage Scrum teams

I regularly took part various Scurm related activities such as: creating user stories, sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint review sessions, and backlog management.

**Application Support**

Having worked in software companies, I am accutely aware of requiment for continual service maintenance and the need for BAU operations. I am ITIL v3 certified, and am familiar with ticketing systems such as Zendesk, and Service Now.

**Documentation**

You don't like doing it, I don't like doing it, nobody likes doing it. Throughout my career, particularly as a Product Owner, documentation was core responsibility. I am familiar with updating and maintaining documentation, and editing and updating internal wikis.

I don't like it, but I do it because it must be done (and because knowledge is the [path to wisdom and enlightenment](http://johnkapeleris.com/blog/?p=1752)).
